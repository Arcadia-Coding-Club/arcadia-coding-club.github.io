                    at Arcadia High School. My passion for coding stems from my first Scratch class in middle school.
                    I'm experienced in the languages C, Python, Flask, SQL, HTML/CSS, and React/React Native, also I
                    have completed online courses such as Harvard's CS50 and taking AP Computer Science.</h3>

                <h3 id="officer-text">Hi, I am Jeffrey. I have started learning programming from a young age, first
                    starting out with HTML/CSS. From there, I have learned JS, Java, and C# Java was the first real
                    language that I learned and it has always been my favorite language with its OOP. From there, I
                    learned C# (as it is quite similar) and was introduced to ASP.NET. ASP.NET made a difference for me
                    because of it rapid development allowing me to make multiple projects with limited time. During this
                    time, I also got interested by Ray Tracing and Neural Networks. I joined the App Development Team
                    where I learned Android programming.</h3>

                    C. I mainly participate in competitive programming competitions using C++ and make apps like the
                    Arcadia High Mobile app or the Applied Engineering app with Swift. I’ve also had a bit of experience
                    programming micro-controllers like Raspberry Pis, messing around in the Windows Kernel, and some
                    experience with local network communication (specifically with the library ZeroMQ) using protocols
                    like TCP and UDP.</h3>

                    currently a sophomore. I first started coding when my parents threw me into a coding class in middle
                    school and eventually, I started to like coding. I have experience in web development and a bit of
                    Java. As for coding programs, I did the Girls Who Code SIP program and learned how to do web
                    development throughout the program. I am currently taking AP Computer Science A at Arcadia High
                    School. I’m excited to start my first year as a coding club officer!</h3>
